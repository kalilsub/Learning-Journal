                            After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer
                            Career Path, I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to 
                            get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects projects and meet 
                            like-minded peers.

                <p class="hero-text feature bold">How I stay committed to learning</p>
                <p class="hero-text feature">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. 
                    I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create 
                    simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into 
                    existing projects.</p>
                <p class="hero-text feature">While that was fun, I felt like it would be 
                    helpful to share what I was learning and most things 
                    about my journey with the world.</p>
                <p class="hero-text feature bold">How I got started</p>
                <p class="hero-text feature">I started simple and gradually grew my 
                    learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was learning. 
                    After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what 
                    I learned but also write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
                <p class="hero-text feature">That helped me grok what I was learning, and I realized 
                    that posting my learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay
                     motivated.</p>
